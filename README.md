# 📊 Time Series Analysis with Python

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating **time series analysis techniques** using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `statsmodels`, and `matplotlib`. It includes practical implementations on real or simulated datasets and focuses on **trend**, **seasonality**, and **forecasting** components.
